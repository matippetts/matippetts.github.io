### Develop the overall model
{: .phase }

This phase involves functional decomposition of the problem domain into subject areas, subject areas into business activities, and business activities into actions.

### Build feature list
{: .phase }

This phase results in a backlog of feature requests.

### Plan by feature
{: .phase}

This phase produces a schedule for a development iteration. In a team effort, model classes are assigned owners.

### Design by feature
{: .phase }

This phase produces a design package and a UML sequence diagram. Following the sequence diagram, method signatures are assigned to classes. For MVC architectures, a design package comprises a model, a view, and a controller.

### Build by feature
{: .phase }

This phase produces source code, an integration test, and unit test artifacts.
