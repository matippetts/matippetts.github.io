Neither of the two bug reports on [issue #47](https://github.com/magbicaleman/open-in-browser/issues/47) documents the steps necessary to reproduce the error. (Wantonly, the first one actually quotes the relevant fragment of the bug-report template, replacing the placeholder text with ellipses instead of filling out the steps.) Both include (identical) stack traces.
