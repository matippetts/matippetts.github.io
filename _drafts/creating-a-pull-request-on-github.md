I forked [open-in-browser](https://github.com/magbicaleman/open-in-browser) and cloned the fork to my workstation:
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:matippetts/open-in-browser.git
```
I added the original repo as a remote named "upstream":
``` bash
git add remote git@github.com:magbicaleman/open-in-browser.git
```

I edited the coffeescript file
