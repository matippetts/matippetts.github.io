I want to make an online cookbook. I know there are already millions out there. The main problem with _them_ is that there are millions. I already have an impressive collection of analog cookbooks too, including one titled _The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook_. But I have no use for a thousand recipes. Ten recipes are invaluable; a thousand are worthless.

I don't want to collect recipes; I want to hack them.
