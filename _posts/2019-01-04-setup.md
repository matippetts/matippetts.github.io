title: Setting up Jekyll for GitHub Pages to run locally

### <span id="settings">Server setup</span>

To start, I created a repository on GitHub named `matippetts.github.io`. In this new repository, I used the settings tab to make a couple of changes:
1. Under the **Features** section, I added issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.
2. Under the **GitHub Pages** section, I selected a dark theme, _"Hacker."_

<aside>I have a lot of trouble with glare from computer monitors. Normally, I use <a href="https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader">accessibility software</a> to change the appearance of websites. But I want to see what visitors will see, so I'm using a dark theme to develop this site. I had two choices: Hacker, or Midnight. I settled on the former, preferring the wider margins and larger print. Nevertheless, I may change it later, because the name is dorkey.</aside>

### <span id="local">Workspace setup</span>

Next I made a local copy of the repo:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/matippetts/matippetts.github.io.git
```
Then I created a new file named `Gemfile` in the local repo, with the following content:
``` ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```
and committed this change:
``` bash
git add Gemfile
git commit -m "Create Gemfile" -a
```

Next, following the instructions in the README.md for the [GitHub Pages Ruby Gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem), I issued the following commands:
``` bash
gem update bundler
bundle install
```
The second command presented a choice: I could enter my password to install the gems globally using `sudo`; or I could cancel and start over, installing the gems to a subfolder of the repo. I expect to add a number of projects to my portfolio, and I'll be using Jekyll to maintain the GitHub Pages for all of them. So I decided to do a global install, rather than repeatedly downloading the dependencies to a dozen local repos.

Bundler installed 85 gems and created a new file: `Gemfile.lock`. A quick peek at StackOverflow informed me [I should commit this file to git](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4151540/6092135). So I did:
``` bash
git add Gemfile.lock
git commit -m "Check in Gemfile.lock (generated by Bundler)" -a
```
At this point, I was able to build the site by running `bundle exec jekyll build`. Running `bundle exec jekyll serve` allowed me to open the local site at http://localhost:4000. So I went off to eat a couple of celebratory celery stalks and watch an episode of Van Helsing.

### <span id="structure">Structure</span>

After I got back from watching Middle-Aged Buffy, it was time to lay the foundations for creating actual content. I started by creating a number of folders suggested by the Jekyll documentation on ["Directory Structure"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/):
```
+
|- _data
|- _drafts
|- _posts
```

<aside>Since I'm using "Hacker," the gem-based theme I configured <a href="#settings">earlier</a>, I didn't create `_layout`, `_includes`, or `_sass` folders.</aside>
